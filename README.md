When you open the (.PBIT) file, it will attempt to load data from the repository files contained in the "Data/" subfolder.

- **Please paste the repository's local path into the pop-up that asks you for the value of the "Local Root Folder" parameter.** This will allow Power BI to load from the local data files that have been downloaded to the "Data/" sub-directory of this repository.

After Power BI loads the data, you can save it as a (.PBIX) file, which will have the data pre-loaded.
