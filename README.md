# GHGRP-Public

This dashboard is based on the [GHG Reporting Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/facility-reporting.html), under which Canadian facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to Environment and Climate Change Canada, if their total annual emissions exceed a regulatory threshold.

Data Sources: [GHGRP on Open Data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a8ba14b7-7f23-462a-bdbb-83b0ef629823); NAICS industry classification ([2012](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/naics/2012/index), [2017](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/naics/2017/index)).

Notes:

– Facilities' latitude and longitude coordinates have only been reported since 2013.

– The reporting threshold was 100,000 tonnes CO₂ eq. for 2004–2008, 50,000 for 2009–2016, and then 10,000 for 2017.

– The dataset uses NAICS 2012 for 2004–2016, and NAICS 2017 for 2017.
