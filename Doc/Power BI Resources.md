## Visuals

[Power BI accessibility and usability guide.](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/file/view/46858653/powerbi-accessibility-and-usability-guide?language=en) This guide was created by a GoC team that spent some time optimizing the user experience of their dashboards, capturing the tips and tricks they learned.

[Function reference.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/power-query-m-function-reference) I usually have this open when developing Power BI queries, to quickly look up information on any functions that I might want to use.

[Language specification.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/power-query-m-language-specification) This was helpful to understand the general structure and approach of the M Query programming language.
